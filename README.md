This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug related to manipulating the innerHTML property in HTML. The bug.html file showcases the problematic code, while bugSolution.html provides a more efficient and robust solution.  The issue arises from repeatedly appending to the existing innerHTML.  While functional in simple cases, it is inefficient and can lead to performance issues with large amounts of data or frequent updates.
